# Procrystalline Lattices
Monte Carlo code written in C++ to generate a range of 2D procrystalline lattices based on a range of underlying lattice and node coordinations.

## Background

Procrystalline lattices have atomic units located on a regular array of points, but fewer bonds than the underlying lattice can accommodate [[1]](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10445).
Therefore whilst they may appear crystalline in terms of the atomic positions, the ring structure is disordered and displays no long range order.
2D procrystals can be generated by a zero-temperature Monte Carlo algorithm [TBC].

## Compilation 

Compilation is easiest using CMake.
To compile the code execute the following in terminal:
```commandline
cd src/
cmake .
make
```
It is recommended that in the
```CMakeCache.txt``` you set ```CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release``` before making.

The generated executable is called ```procrystal.x```.

## Input

The parameters for the calculation can be found in ```procrystal.inpt``` which are read at runtime.
An example input file is given below:

### Procrystal Properties 

These options determine the nature of the procrystalline lattice.

* Lattice type: underlying regular or semi-regular lattice for the atomic positions.
* Node coordination: number of bonds for each atom.
* Link orientations: orientation of bonds for each atom. Random allows any orientation, pattern1 a specified orientation which is chiral, pattern2 a specified orientation which is a racemic mixture.
* Pattern code: applies if pattern1 or pattern2 selected and defines bond orientations. Here 1 is used to specify bonds, 0 an absence. The pattern total must match the node coordination.
* Lattice dimension: controls size of the lattice. Only certain values are allowed depending on the underlying lattice type.

### Monte Carlo Parameters

These options control the Monte Carlo process.

* Random seed: initialiser for random number generator. The same seed gives the same lattice.
* Temperature: temperature for Metropolis criterion. Zero-temperature seems to work well in all cases.
* Samples: the number of procrystalline samples to generate.

### Output 

* Output prefix: prefix for output files.
* Write samples: whether to write configurations for visualisation.
* All the other options are legacy really, RDF and structure factor calculations will be crystalline. Set to false.

## Runtime

Running ```procrystal.x``` will read the input file and start the code. A log file, ```procrystal.log```,
will also be produced which is quite verbose.

## Output and Visualisation

After the code has finished there should be several ```.dat``` files, prefixed with your output prefix.

* ```*_pk.dat```: ring statistics aggregated across all procrystalline samples.
* ```*_net.dat```: network metrics, primary ring proportion, mean ring size, variance in ring size distribution, assortativity, Aboav-Weaire analysis  
* Other files containing specific configuration information.

## Examples

Please check out the gallery for some examples, which show some visualisations of example outputs.

## Summary

This is a very brief overview of the code, designed to get some output.
Please let me know if you want to use it for research purposes and I will be happy to help.
